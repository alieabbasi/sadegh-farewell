# Product Manager Exit Counter

This TypeScript project aims to create a simple counter that tracks the exits of our team's product manager. The counter will be implemented using TypeScript to keep track of the number of times the product manager exits the company.


## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command will compile the TypeScript code and start the application.

2. **Interact with the Counter:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the counter interface.
   - Use the provided buttons or input fields to increment or view the exit count of the product manager.
